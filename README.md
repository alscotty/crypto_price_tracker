# Crypto Price Tracker (WIP)

A work-in-progress crypto price tracker designed for testing purposes. This project connects to the Coinbase WebSocket API to fetch live crypto price data, displays it on an interactive graph, and provides an option to simulate "trades." The ultimate goal is to use this tool for algorithmic trading strategy testing.

## Features
- **Live Price Tracking:** Real-time price data from the Coinbase WebSocket API.
- **Interactive Graph:** Visualize price changes dynamically using a live tracker graph.
- **Simulated Trades:** Test trade logic by "buying" and "selling" virtual assets.
- **Bot Buy/Sell Behavior:** Automated transactions.
- **Algorithmic Testing (Coming Soon):** Future updates will include support for algorithmic trading strategy tests.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Charts:** Chart.js (or another library, if applicable)
- **WebSocket Data Feed:** Coinbase WebSocket API
- **Backend (if applicable):** Node.js
